# ESP-IDF Bootstrap Component Library

Standalone ESP-IDF bootstrap component library. Reusable wifi provisioning, NVS, HTTP server, OTA, log streaming, display, and board abstraction components for any ESP-IDF firmware project.

## Public symbol prefix

All public C symbols use prefix `bb_`.

## Portability discipline

Public headers must not include `esp_*.h` or `freertos/*.h` outside `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM`. This is enforced so non-ESP-IDF platform backends (e.g. Arduino) can coexist without breaking consumers.

The `bb_info` component demonstrates the portable-header pattern: its public extender callback takes a `bb_json_t` handle (from `bb_json`) rather than a backend-specific pointer, so consumer headers stay free of cJSON/ArduinoJson includes. Platform-specific logic lives under `platform/espidf/` and `platform/host/`.

For the Arduino backend specifically:
- Log format strings (`bb_log_*` calls) should be wrapped in `F()` to force them into PROGMEM to preserve SRAM on tiny platforms (2 KB on Uno). For now, breadboard's own logging is sparse enough that this is deferred — only enforce it when a real project hits SRAM pressure.
- Backend implementations are in `platform/arduino/<component>/` as `.cpp` files (not `.c`), since the Arduino framework and ecosystem (EEPROM, Serial, libraries) are C++ native.
- `bb_http` on Arduino batches the entire response (status + headers + body) into a single `client.write()` call due to unreliable `fastrprint()` flush behavior across many tiny writes. Request bodies are not supported to save SRAM on resource-constrained targets.

## API conventions

Public headers under `components/*/include/` follow these rules so that the same header compiles unchanged on ESP-IDF, Arduino, and host test backends.

- **Return `bb_err_t`**, never `esp_err_t` (or any other platform type). `bb_err_t` is a typedef for `esp_err_t` under ESP-IDF and `int` elsewhere — values pass through unchanged.
- **Log via `bb_log_*`**, never `ESP_LOG*`. Portable impls live under `platform/<backend>/bb_log/`.
- **No `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` in public headers.** If a function needs an ESP-IDF type in its signature, wrap it behind an opaque `bb_*` handle (see `bb_http_request_t` wrapping `httpd_req_t *`).
- **No ESP-IDF headers** (`esp_err.h`, `esp_http_server.h`, `nvs_flash.h`, …) included transitively from public headers. Private `.c` files may include them freely.

When extending an existing component: match the existing style even if older code predates these rules; a PR that flips 10 functions without migrating the rest is churn.

## Logging

Use `bb_log_{e,w,i,d,v}(tag, fmt, ...)` macros for all breadboard component code. On ESP-IDF these expand to `ESP_LOG{E,W,I,D,V}`; on host they map to `fprintf` (debug/verbose compile out to keep test output clean).

## Layout

- Components under `components/<name>/` with public headers.
- Platform-specific implementations under `platform/espidf/` and `platform/arduino/`.
- Component names are prefixed `bb_`.

## Embedding assets

Use the CMake helper `bb_embed_assets()` in `cmake/bb_embed.cmake` to embed binary assets (HTML, fonts, images, etc.) into firmware. The helper wraps the raw `scripts/embed_html.py` CLI tool, which converts a file to a gzipped C byte-array source file: `python3 scripts/embed_html.py <input> <output.c> <symbol>`. Components include the helper with `include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../cmake/bb_embed.cmake")` and call it before `idf_component_register` to populate `SRCS`. The helper avoids duplicating `add_custom_command` boilerplate across breadboard components and downstream consumers (TaipanMiner, snugfeather).

## Provisioning UI

The `bb_prov` component manages the provisioning state machine and HTTP `/save` handler. Callers MUST supply at least one asset with `path="/"` to `bb_prov_start`. For bare-minimum bringup, add `REQUIRES bb_prov_default_form` and pass `&bb_prov_default_form_asset`. Custom UIs pass their own asset array instead. `POST /save` returns `204 No Content`; the caller's form JS is responsible for post-submit UX.

## Display

LVGL is initialized inside `bb_display_init` via `esp_lvgl_port`. The consumer's `sdkconfig` governs LVGL font availability (`CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_*`) and color depth (must be 16-bit / RGB565); breadboard does not ship pre-defined dashboard layouts. Every call into LVGL from application code (including `lv_timer` callbacks not running on the LVGL task) must be wrapped in `bb_display_lock` / `bb_display_unlock`. The `bb_display` component is currently ESP-IDF-only.
